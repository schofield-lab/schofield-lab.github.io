## Research overview

Our group studies the quantum properties of matter at the atomic scale, with a focus on
scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES),
and the theory of defects and dopants in semiconductors and 2D materials.

This page will gradually collect short summaries of our main research themes together with
selected talks and presentations.
