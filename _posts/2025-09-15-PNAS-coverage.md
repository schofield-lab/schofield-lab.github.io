``First-of-its-kind image may suggest new ways to use silicon defects in quantum devices.'' We are delighted that **PNAS Journal Club** has written about our latest publication, highlighting the significance of our work on imaging acceptor wave functions in silicon.   

The article provides a clear and accessible discussion of how our experimental approach reveals new insight into optically active defects.  This feature is an exciting recognition of our groupâ€™s efforts to combine atomic-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy with theoretical modelling. It underscores the potential of engineered defects as building blocks for future quantum technologies.
