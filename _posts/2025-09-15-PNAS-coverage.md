We are delighted that **PNAS Journal Club** has written about our latest publication, highlighting the significance of our work on imaging acceptor wave functions in silicon.  

The article, titled *“First-of-its-kind image may suggest new ways to use silicon defects in silicon-based quantum devices”*, provides a clear and accessible discussion of how our experimental approach reveals new insight into optically active defects.

This feature is an exciting recognition of our group’s efforts to combine atomic-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy with theoretical modelling. It underscores the potential of engineered defects as building blocks for future quantum technologies.
