Weâ€™re pleased to launch our new group website --- [schofield-lab.github.io](https://schofield-lab.github.io) --- and with it, our group blog! Until now, our pages were hosted within the main UCL website. Ongoing changes to location, styling, and the content management system made it increasingly difficult to keep that site up to date. At the same time, a number of excellent free hosting options for academic websites have become available.  

After looking around, we decided that GitHub Pages would be a good fit, and that the [Lab Website Template](https://github.com/greenelab/lab-website-template) provided an ideal starting point.

The template makes it easy to add our own content without worrying too much about style and layout. Features such as automatic import of citations from the ORCID database are a delight and save a lot of time while simultaneously increasing the visibility of our research.
