We are delighted that our work has been featured on the **cover of Nano Letters** (Vol. 25, Issue 38). The cover image (see below) shows an image we took of acceptor wave functions in silicon, showing for the first time how these states can be directly visualized with atomic-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy. Along with accompanying tunnelling spectroscopy data, and theoretical calculations, our work provides critical insight into the anisotropy of these acceptor states, paving the way for defect-based quantum technologies in silicon.  

The experiments were performed at UCL by **Manuel Siegl** and **Holly Hedgeland**, whose STM measurements gave the first direct view of the anisotropic ground-state wave function of an acceptor in silicon. The theoretical work was carried out by **Michael Flatté and his group** at the University of Iowa and the Eindhoven University of Technology, with **Julian Zanon** providing effective-mass calculations and **Joe Sink** contributing tight-binding simulations. This collaboration grew out of Michael’s sabbatical at UCL, illustrating how research visits can spark long-term partnerships and lead to important results.  

Through this international collaboration, we have achieved a clear quantitative description of the highly anisotropic acceptor wave function observed at the (100) surface of hydrogen-terminated silicon. The results point towards new strategies for designing quantum technologies in silicon utilising acceptor rather than donor states.
