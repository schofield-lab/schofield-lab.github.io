This week we were delighted to welcome two new PhD students to the group, Byron Gamble and Sean Egan. To mark the occasion, we had a group lunch at a long-standing and old group favourite, the vegetarian Indian restaurant Chutneys on Drummond St. 

It was also a nice opportunity for everyone to spend some time together, including Hardeep, who is visiting from the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, Niels, visiting from the University of Iowa, and Georgia, who has been busy lately writing her transfer report.

The two studentships that support Sean and Byron have been made possible by EPSRC/UCL and international collaborations: Sean’s is with the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland and Byron’s project is in collaboration with A\*STAR in Singapore. The two projects will focus on different aspects of developing the fundamental science needed for atomic-scale control of semiconductors, which underpins potential applications in quantum technology. You can read more about this general research field in the recent [*Roadmap on atomic-scale semiconductor devices*](https://doi.org/10.1088/2399-1984/ada901), which I coordinated together with five guest editors. The Roadmap brings together contributions from over 50 researchers from around the world, including us at UCL, and reviews 25 years of progress since Kane’s proposal for donor-based qubits in silicon.
