This week marks the end of a six-week visit by Hardeep, a PhD student from Akshay Singh’s group at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. His visit was supported by a [Royal Society International Exchanges](https://royalsociety.org/grants/international-exchanges/) grant, with the initial contact made possible through the [UCL Global Engagement scheme](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/global/ucl-global-engagement).

It has been a real pleasure hosting Hardeep in our lab, who quickly became a valued member of our team. His enthusiasm and his experience as a third-year PhD student saw him settle into a mentorship role for our two new students, even while learning to operate much of our equipment himself. Over the course of his visit, he mastered most aspects of running our ultrahigh-vacuum scanning tunnelling microscope (UHV-STM) and even helped troubleshoot the system when the occasion arose. Hardeep brought to our lab knowledge and skills for the preparation of 2D materials, which he has learned for in relation to the preparation of 2D materials for optical measurements, and he will leave with an entirely new skill set in preparing samples for measurement in UHV and atomic-scale measurement with STM. The knowledge exchange facilitated by Hardeep's visit extends beyond sample preparation too---the initial stages of analysing the data he has obtained during his visit has already introduced Hardeep to some new concepts in condensed matter physics, and it will be exciting to see how this develops as the work of processing, analysing, and interpretting the data continues. Hardeep also participated in our weekely group meetings, providing us with a talk from his previous research and participating in discussions relating to the research of other group members.

The goals of his visit were to investigate defects in molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) and to develop methods for contacting and imaging monolayer flakes of exfoliated two-dimensional materials. We made excellent progress on both fronts, which places Hardeep in a strong position for his return visit to UCL, planned for 2026. During his stay, we successfully imaged bulk MoS<sub>2</sub> samples with atomic resolution, and investigated defect structures. The resulting data are promising, and the analysis and interpretation will continue collaboratively after Hardeep’s return to Bangalore.

In addition to the STM work, Hardeep received training to access several of our other laboratories, including facilities for optical microscopy—equipment similar to what he regularly uses at IISc. These complementary techniques allow us to study our samples across vastly different length scales, from optical to atomic resolution. Through this combined work, we are developing the capability to investigate monolayer 2D samples alongside bulk materials, broadening the scope of our joint research. It will be exciting now to see how the analysis of our data proceeds over the coming months as we simultaneously develop a plan for the measurements we will make during Hardeep's return visit in 2026.
