This week marks the end of a six-week visit by Hardeep, a PhD student from Akshay Singh’s group at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. His visit was supported by a [Royal Society International Exchanges](https://royalsociety.org/grants/international-exchanges/) grant, with the initial contact made possible through the [UCL Global Engagement scheme](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/global/ucl-global-engagement).

It has been a real pleasure hosting Hardeep in our lab. He quickly became a valued member of the team, bringing both enthusiasm and experience. As a senior PhD student in his own group, he naturally took on a mentorship role for our new students—even while learning to operate much of our equipment himself. Over the course of his visit, he mastered most aspects of running our ultrahigh-vacuum scanning tunnelling microscope (UHV-STM) and even helped troubleshoot the system when the occasion arose.

The goals of his visit were to investigate defects in molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) and to develop methods for contacting and imaging monolayer flakes of exfoliated two-dimensional materials. We made excellent progress on both fronts, which places Hardeep in a strong position for his return visit to UCL, planned for 2026. During his stay, we successfully imaged bulk MoS<sub>2</sub> samples with atomic resolution, and investigated defect structures. The resulting data are promising, and the analysis and interpretation will continue collaboratively after Hardeep’s return to Bangalore.

In addition to the STM work, Hardeep received training to access several of our other laboratories, including facilities for optical microscopy—equipment similar to what he regularly uses at IISc. These complementary techniques allow us to study our samples across vastly different length scales, from optical to atomic resolution. Through this combined work, we are developing the capability to investigate monolayer 2D samples alongside bulk materials, broadening the scope of our joint research.

We are sad to see Hardeep leave, but delighted that this is only a pause—he will be returning to UCL next year as part of the continuing collaboration. We look forward to welcoming him back and to the next stage of this exciting project.
