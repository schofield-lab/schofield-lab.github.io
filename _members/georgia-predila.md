Georgia joined the group in October 2023 through the Advanced Characterisation of Materials (ACM) CDT, having completed a degree in Natural Sciences at UCL in 2021. Her PhD focuses on arsenic δ-doped layers in germanium, studied using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and soft x-ray angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (SX-ARPES).  

This work has so far involved sample preparation and STM experiments at UCL, secondary ion mass spectrometry at Imperial College London, and SX-ARPES measurements at the Petra III synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg). She has also contributed to a complementary project on hydrogen lithography of the H-terminated Ge(001) surface for controlled deposition of arsine (AsH₃).
