Niels is a PhD student in the group of [Michael Flatté](https://frg.physics.uiowa.edu) at the University of Iowa and a frequent visitor to our lab. His research focuses on theoretical studies of dopant-based quantum electronic systems. At UCL, he has been developing theory to complement our soft X-ray angle-resolved photoemission (SX-ARPES) measurements of δ-doped silicon, work that will appear in his forthcoming first-author publication *Brillouin-zone-selection effects in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of silicon*. He is also interested in semiconductor conductivity near the metal–insulator transition and correlations between donor states in dilute δ-layers.  

Niels’ visits form part of a long-standing collaboration between our group and that of Michael Flatté, bringing together Flatté’s expertise in theory with our strengths in experiment.
