Sean joined the group in October 2025 as a PhD student funded through the UCL EPSRC Landscape Awards (UELA) with collaborative funding from the Paul Scherrer Institute (Switzerland). His project, *Atomic-Scale Quantum Science for Scalable Quantum Technology*, addresses the challenge of achieving scalable qubits by exploring silicon- and germanium-based atomic-scale devices.

His research combines cryogenic scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and atomic-scale fabrication at UCL with advanced photoelectron and lithographic methods at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). The project is co-supervised by Steven Schofield (UCL) and Yasin Ekinci (PSI â€” [bio](https://www.psi.ch/en/lxn/people/yasin-ekinci)).
