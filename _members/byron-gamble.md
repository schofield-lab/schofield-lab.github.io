Byron joined the group in October 2025 as a PhD student funded through the Molecular Modelling & Materials Science (M3S) CDT in partnership with A*STAR in Singapore. He holds a BSc in Chemistry from the University of Manchester and an MRes in Green Chemistry from Imperial College London.  

His PhD research combines scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) studies at UCL with device fabrication and low-temperature measurements at A*STAR. The project is co-supervised by Steven Schofield (UCL) and [Kuan Eng Johnson Goh](https://research.a-star.edu.sg/researcher/kuan-eng-johnson-goh/) (A*STAR). Byron will spend his first year at UCL before continuing his research at A*STAR in Singapore.
