Hardeep is a visiting PhD student from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, where he works in the group of [Akshay Singh](https://physics.iisc.ac.in/people/akshay-singh/). He will spend two extended visits in our group between March 2025 and March 2027, supported by a [Royal Society award](https://royalsociety.org/grants/international-exchanges/). His research focuses on the optical and atomic-scale properties of defects in two-dimensional materials, combining optical spectroscopy at IISc with atomic-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy at UCL. This award and Hardeepâ€™s visits are serving to strengthen ties between our group and that of Akshay Singh, with the aim of further developing this collaboration in the future.
