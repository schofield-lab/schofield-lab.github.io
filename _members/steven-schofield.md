I studied physics in Australia at the University of Newcastle (BSc) and the University of New South Wales (PhD). My doctoral work, supervised by Professors Robert Clark and Michelle Simmons, strongly influenced my approach to research. Following my PhD, I was awarded an Australian Postdoctoral Fellowship, which provided the foundation for launching my independent research career. In 2008, I moved to the UK and in 2009 was awarded a five-year EPSRC Career Acceleration Fellowship. I joined UCL as a Lecturer in 2012 and have since progressed to Professor of Physics, with a joint appointment at the London Centre for Nanotechnology and the Department of Physics and Astronomy.

My research explores the quantum properties of matter at the atomic scale, using ultrahigh vacuum cryogenic scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), synchrotron-based techniques such as momentum-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES), and theoretical approaches including density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML). I am particularly interested in how atomic-scale quantum properties can be harnessed for future classical and quantum information technologies.
