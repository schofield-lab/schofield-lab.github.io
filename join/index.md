# Join Our Team

We are always looking for motivated students and researchers to join our group.  Our work combines experiment and theory at the atomic scale to explore the physics of semiconductors and 2D materials, and we aim to provide a collaborative environment where team members develop strong expertise while contributing to cutting-edge research.
