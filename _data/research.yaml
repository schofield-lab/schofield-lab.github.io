  description: >
    We probe the electronic structure of quantum systems buried inside silicon by
    using soft X-ray ARPES to access their full three-dimensional band structure.

  description: >
    We investigate how individual molecules adsorb, bond, and react on semiconductor
    surfaces using atomic-resolution STM combined with first-principles DFT modelling.
    This work underpins the development of atomically precise dopant incorporation
    in semiconductors and lays the foundation for atomic-scale electronic devices.
